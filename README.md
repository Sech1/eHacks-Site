This is the 2017 fall version of the eHacks website for SIUE.<br />
The event was sponsored by SIUE and various other corporate sponsors.<br />
I updated the site, made a new registration page, wrote the script (JS & PHP)<br />
to handle registration and managed the SQL back-end (users uploading resumes,
registration information, etc).<br />
I also wrote the script to mass email users, and designed the html based emails
that were sent out to users.<br />
<br />
The website does use bootstrap for the CSS and some styling/effects.<br />
