This is the 2017 fall version of the eHacks website for SIUE.
The event was sponsored by SIUE and various other corporate sponsors.
I updated the site, made a new registration page, wrote the script (JS & PHP)
to handle registration and managed the SQL back-end (users uploading resumes,
registration information, etc).
I also wrote the script to mass email users, and designed the html based emails
that were sent out to users.

The website does use bootstrap for the CSS and some styling/effects.
